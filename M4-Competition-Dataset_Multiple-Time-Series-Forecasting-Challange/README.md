# About Dataset

M4 is one of the most prestigeous international competition of Time Series. M4 Dataset was made in December 28th, 2017 by Prof Markidakis from randomly selected 100.000 Continuous Time Series Data from varios business realm within ForeDeck Database. During competitions, each candidate could choose one of the followings Time Series Category, which are: Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, Daily, and Hourly Data. 
For Hourly Data, it contains 414 different Hourly Time Series which has minimum 700 periods. To ensure objectivity of the competition, dataset have no observation of the date_time information and any other information regarding to the origin of individual time series. but we know that all Time Series has the same frequency. It is also important to mention that the dataset itself has been preprocessed so that the data has range of min 10 and has no negative observation to prevent error during model assessments. 

# Goals and Objectives of the M4 Competition:
1. Evaluate Forecasting Methods:
The main goal of the M4 competition is to identify the most accurate forecasting methods across different types of time series. It allows researchers and practitioners to test their methods and compare their performance.
2. Advance Forecasting Techniques:
By providing such a large and diverse dataset, the competition encourages the development of innovative forecasting techniques that can generalize well to various real-world data.
3. Benchmarking:
The competition provides a common benchmark for researchers to evaluate their models. It encourages transparency and collaboration by allowing direct comparison between classical statistical methods and new machine learning-based approaches.
4. Encourage Replicability:
The competition promotes reproducible research. All methods are shared openly, allowing the community to replicate, critique, and improve upon the results.
5. Promote Hybrid Methods:
One of the outcomes of the M4 competition was the discovery that hybrid models, which combine traditional statistical methods with machine learning approaches, often performed better than single methods alone.
